# OAuth-Prototype-Client-Okta

This was the first working OAuth Client prototype that I got to successfully crosstalk and share client-id and client-secret with the Server Client AuthorizationServerApplication. Thie prototype solution was demoed for our team, however the group voted to not utilize it.
